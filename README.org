** Prerequisites

Upon first launch you will be asked to give =org-outlook= permission to read and write to
your Outlook calendar. Note: Some organisations will have disabled third-party
applications. In this case, unfortunately, you won't be able to use =org-outlook=. 

** Dependencies

 - [[https://www.gnupg.org/][gnupg]]: org-outlook requires you to have a public/private gpg keypair capable of encryption
 - [[http://github.com/lujun9972/html2org.el][html2org]]
 - [[https://github.com/ndwarshuis/org-ml][org-ml]]
 - [[https://github.com/org-roam][org-roam]]
 - [[https://github.com/jeremy-compostella/org-msg][org-msg]]  
 - [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request/tree/master][emacs-request]]  
 - [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize]]

** Optional
 
A standard oauth client is provided with =org-outlook=, you are of course, free to use your
own Microsoft Entra App Registration instead. To do so you will need to create an App
Registration in Microsoft Entra (Formally Azure Active Directory) via
[[https://portal.azure.com]]. Optionally make a note of your =tenant-id= (you can provide
=org-outlook-tenant-id= to restrict the scope of your app to your Azure tenant). The app
will need the =Calendars.Read=, =Calendars.ReadWrite=, and =offline_access= API
permissions. Under "Authentication" click =Add a platform= and add =http://localhost:9004= as
the redirect uri. At the bottom of the page ensure =Allow public client flows= is toggled to
"Yes". From the "Overview" tab copy the =Application (client) id= and insert into your
config as specified below.

  
** Quelpa

The package =org-outlook= is not currently available from [[https://melpa.org/#/org-ql][MELPA]], but can be installed
directly from github with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]].

Installing with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]] is easy:

1.  Install [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package#installation][quelpa-use-package]] (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
2.  Add this form to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package org-outlook
  :quelpa (org-outlook :fetcher github :repo "ifitzpat/org-outlook")
  :config
  ;(setq org-outlook-client-id "client-id-of-your-registered-app") ;; OPTIONAL
  ;(setq org-outlook-tenant-id "your-azure-tenant-id") ;; OPTIONAL
  (setq org-outlook-gpg-recipient "you@example.com")
  (setq org-outlook-local-timezone "Europe/Berlin") ; Your local time zone
  (setq org-outlook-file "/path/to/outlook.org")
  (setq org-outlook-sync-start 14) ; number of days in the past to keep in sync
  (setq org-outlook-sync-end 90) ; number of days in the future to keep in sync
  )

** Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      ignore-children
:END:

+  *Syncing Outlook events:*
     -  =org-outlook-sync=
+  *Accepting a meeting request:*
     - With point on the entry in the agenda view or within the org entry body: =org-outlook-accept-event= 
+  *Declining a meeting request:*
     - With point on the entry in the agenda view or within the org entry body: =org-outlook-decline-event= 
+  *Joining a Teams meeting:*
     - With point on the entry in the agenda view or within the org entry body: =org-outlook-join-teams-call= 

** Tips

+ Calling =org-outlook-sync= via =emacs --batch= avoids blocking your main emacs session.

Potential fix for duplicate event creation when going to/from DST

** 0.0.2-pre-alpha

Switch to PKCE oauth flow & provide default auth client

Initial release

* Notes
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      ignore-children
:END:

** Known issues

 - Winter-to-summer time switching may cause duplicate events to appear. /Possible fixed as of
   0.0.3/
 - Events that are rescheduled sometimes show up twice.
 - Accepting an event doesn't change the event status from =REQUEST= to =MEETING= until the
   next sync.

** Info export options

#+TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY: Emacs
#+TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE: Org Outlook: (org-outlook)

# NOTE: We could use these, but that causes a pointless error, "org-compile-file: File "..README.info" wasn't produced...", so we just rename the files in the after-save-hook instead.
# #+TEXINFO_FILENAME: org-outlook.info
# #+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: org-outlook.texi

** File-local variables

# NOTE: Setting org-comment-string buffer-locally is a nasty hack to work around GitHub's org-ruby's HTML rendering, which does not respect noexport tags.  The only way to hide this tree from its output is to use the COMMENT keyword, but that prevents Org from processing the export options declared in it.  So since these file-local variables don't affect org-ruby, wet set org-comment-string to an unused keyword, which prevents Org from deleting this tree from the export buffer, which allows it to find the export options in it.  And since org-export does respect the noexport tag, the tree is excluded from the info page.

# Local Variables:
# before-save-hook: org-make-toc
# after-save-hook: (lambda nil (when (and (require 'ox-texinfo nil t) (org-texinfo-export-to-info)) (delete-file "README.texi") (rename-file "README.info" "org-ql.info" t)))
# org-export-initial-scope: buffer
# org-comment-string: "NOTCOMMENT"
