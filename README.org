** Prerequisites

Upon first launch you will be asked to give =org-outlook= permission to read and write to
your Outlook calendar. Note: Some organisations will have disabled third-party
applications. In this case, unfortunately, you won't be able to use =org-outlook=. 

** Dependencies

 - [[https://www.gnupg.org/][gnupg]]: org-outlook requires you to have a public/private gpg keypair capable of encryption
 - [[http://github.com/lujun9972/html2org.el][html2org]]
 - [[https://github.com/ndwarshuis/org-ml][org-ml]]
 - [[https://github.com/jeremy-compostella/org-msg][org-msg]]  
 - [[https://github.com/tkf/emacs-request/tree/master][emacs-request]]  
 - [[https://github.com/hniksic/emacs-htmlize][htmlize]]

** Optional
 
A standard oauth client is provided with =org-outlook=, you are of course, free to use your
own Microsoft Entra App Registration instead. To do so you will need to create an App
Registration in Microsoft Entra (Formally Azure Active Directory) via
[[https://portal.azure.com]]. Optionally make a note of your =tenant-id= (you can provide
=org-outlook-tenant-id= to restrict the scope of your app to your Azure tenant). The app
will need the =Calendars.Read=, =Calendars.ReadWrite=, and =offline_access= API
permissions. Under "Authentication" click =Add a platform= and add =http://localhost:9004= as
the redirect uri. At the bottom of the page ensure =Allow public client flows= is toggled to
"Yes". From the "Overview" tab copy the =Application (client) id= and insert into your
config as specified below.

  
** Quelpa

The package =org-outlook= is not currently available from [[https://melpa.org/#/org-ql][MELPA]], but can be installed
directly from github with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]].

Installing with [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa][Quelpa]] is easy:

1.  Install [[https://framagit.org/steckerhalter/quelpa-use-package#installation][quelpa-use-package]] (which can be installed directly from MELPA).
2.  Add this form to your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(use-package org-outlook
  :quelpa (org-outlook :fetcher github :repo "ifitzpat/org-outlook")
  :config
  ;; Optional: Use your own Microsoft Entra App Registration
  ;(setq org-outlook-client-id "client-id-of-your-registered-app")
  ;(setq org-outlook-tenant-id "your-azure-tenant-id")

  ;; Required settings
  (setq org-outlook-gpg-recipient "you@example.com")
  (setq org-outlook-local-timezone "Europe/Berlin") ; Your local time zone
  (setq org-outlook-file "/path/to/outlook.org")

  ;; Sync range (number of days)
  (setq org-outlook-sync-start 14)  ; days in the past to keep in sync
  (setq org-outlook-sync-end 90)    ; days in the future to keep in sync

  ;; Optional: Customize full sync frequency (default: 7 days)
  (setq org-outlook-full-sync-interval-days 7)  ; weekly validation
  ;(setq org-outlook-full-sync-interval-days 14) ; bi-weekly validation
  ;(setq org-outlook-full-sync-interval-days nil) ; disable automatic full syncs
  )

** Commands
:PROPERTIES:
:TOC:      ignore-children
:END:

+  *Syncing Outlook events:*
     -  =M-x org-outlook-sync= - Intelligent sync (uses delta sync when possible, falls back to full sync as needed)
     -  =C-u M-x org-outlook-sync= - Force full sync (syncs all events regardless)
     -  =M-x org-outlook-full-sync= - Direct full sync

     *How sync works:*
     - *First run*: Automatically performs full sync and initializes delta tracking
     - *Daily use*: Fast delta sync (only processes changes since last sync)
     - *Weekly*: Automatic full sync for validation (configurable with =org-outlook-full-sync-interval-days=)
     - *Error recovery*: Falls back to full sync if delta sync fails
     - *Deleted events*: Automatically removed during delta sync

+  *Accepting a meeting request:*
     - With point on the entry in the agenda view or within the org entry body: =org-outlook-accept-event=
+  *Declining a meeting request:*
     - With point on the entry in the agenda view or within the org entry body: =org-outlook-decline-event=
+  *Joining a Teams meeting:*
     - With point on the entry in the agenda view or within the org entry body: =org-outlook-join-teams-call= 

** Tips

+ Calling =org-outlook-sync= via =emacs --batch= avoids blocking your main emacs session.

/Note:/ Breaking changes may be made before version 1.0, but in the event of major changes, attempts at backward compatibility will be made with obsolescence declarations, translation of arguments, etc.  Users who need stability guarantees before 1.0 may choose to use tagged stable releases.

** 0.1.0-beta (2025-11-20)

Major stability and reliability improvements:

*** Fixed Issues
+ *Issue #1 - DST Duplicates*: Fixed duplicate events during daylight saving time transitions
  - Event IDs now use Outlook ID directly (stable across DST changes)
  - Fixed timestamp parsing to handle local timezone correctly
  - Added error handling for stale org-id cache
  - Each recurring event instance has unique, stable ID
+ *Issue #2 - Refresh Token*: Fixed reversed logic that prevented automatic OAuth flow when refresh token expired
+ *Issue #3 - Auth Code Race Conditions*: Removed blocking sleeps and race conditions from OAuth flow
  - Non-blocking authentication with 5-minute timeout (up from 90 seconds)
  - Proper async handling with state tracking
  - Better user feedback and error messages
+ *Issue #4 - Deleted Meetings*: Implemented intelligent hybrid sync
  - Delta sync for fast daily syncs
  - Automatic full sync for periodic validation
  - Handles deleted and cancelled events properly
  - Self-healing with automatic error recovery

*** New Features
+ Intelligent hybrid sync system (=org-outlook-sync=)
  - Fast delta sync by default
  - Weekly full sync validation (configurable)
  - Automatic fallback on errors
+ New configuration variable: =org-outlook-full-sync-interval-days=
+ Force full sync with prefix argument: =C-u M-x org-outlook-sync=

*** Breaking Changes
+ =org-outlook-sync= behavior changed: now uses delta sync by default (was full sync)
+ Old full sync is now =org-outlook-full-sync=
+ Event IDs changed (will cause re-sync on first run)

** Info export options

#+TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY: Emacs
#+TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE: Org Outlook: (org-outlook)

# NOTE: We could use these, but that causes a pointless error, "org-compile-file: File "..README.info" wasn't produced...", so we just rename the files in the after-save-hook instead.
# #+TEXINFO_FILENAME: org-outlook.info
# #+EXPORT_FILE_NAME: org-outlook.texi

** File-local variables

# NOTE: Setting org-comment-string buffer-locally is a nasty hack to work around GitHub's org-ruby's HTML rendering, which does not respect noexport tags.  The only way to hide this tree from its output is to use the COMMENT keyword, but that prevents Org from processing the export options declared in it.  So since these file-local variables don't affect org-ruby, wet set org-comment-string to an unused keyword, which prevents Org from deleting this tree from the export buffer, which allows it to find the export options in it.  And since org-export does respect the noexport tag, the tree is excluded from the info page.

# Local Variables:
# before-save-hook: org-make-toc
# after-save-hook: (lambda nil (when (and (require 'ox-texinfo nil t) (org-texinfo-export-to-info)) (delete-file "README.texi") (rename-file "README.info" "org-ql.info" t)))
# org-export-initial-scope: buffer
# org-comment-string: "NOTCOMMENT"
